## Assignment 3

**11908757 Stefan Haslhofer**

##### 1. Remarks

Each data sample is denoted by an operation (screw/unscrew) and a grip (grip1/grip2). To eliminate possible confusion I
appended pictures of each grip that I used:

* Grip 1:

* Grip 2:

  <img src="Grip2.jpg" alt="image" width="auto" height="200">

Python code: https://github.com/StefanHaslhofer/PervasiveComputing/tree/main/Assignment3

##### 2. Data recording

To acquire data I taped my mobile phone to my wrist and screwed/unscrewed the same screw six times with each grip.

I recorded the acceleration of my wrist over time on my mobile phone with an app called _Physics Toolbox Sensor Suite_.
The app allows access to the phone's built-in linear accelerometer and displays acceleration on x, y and z axis as well
as a total acceleration value.

The data can be exported as _csv_. Each row contains a timestamp and all axis values plus the total acceleration.

##### 3. Pre-processing and Segmentation

Similar to assignment 2, I plotted the recordings in the time domain and in the frequency domain for a better
understanding of the data. In the previous assignment I concluded that all important frequencies in movements are quite
low. Hence, I also only consider low frequencies up to 50Hz for this assignment.  
Furthermore, I split the data recordings into windows of 5 seconds to get enough samples. I used a jumping window
approach. Windows do not overlap.

<img src="screwGrip1FreqPlot.png" alt="image" width="auto" height="350">

Above you can see two plots of one screw operation using grip 1:

1. x, y and z-axis acceleration plus as well as total acceleration over time
2. frequency composition of total acceleration

##### 4. Feature extraction

Next, I implemented a python script to extract the features and save it to an _arff_-file

First, I calculated mean and variance for the acceleration of my wrist along all axes as well as for the total
wrist acceleration. Looking at the result I noticed that the unscrew operation has a larger acceleration along the
z-axis and the screw operation has more acceleration along the x-axis. However, there is no clear difference in the
total acceleration of each operation (except some outliers) as can be seen in the two plots below:

<img src="screwGrip1TimePlot.png" alt="image" width="auto" height="400">

<img src="unscrewGrip1TimePlot.png" alt="image" width="auto" height="400">

Regarding the grips, there is a clear difference in acceleration for all axes including the total acceleration, which is
much higher for grip 1. Following plots visualize the acceleration of my wrist along all axes during the screwing
operation for both grips:

<img src="screwGrip1TimePlot.png" alt="image" width="auto" height="400">

<img src="screwGrip2TimePlot.png" alt="image" width="auto" height="400">

Unfortunately, the frequency domain seems not very helpful in this assignment. When comparing the graphs of total
acceleration signal frequencies for each operation combined with the grips we can hardly spot any difference except for
the screw operation using grip 1.
At least the amplitude seems to be moderately higher for the unscrew operation compared to the screw operation:

The following table lists all extracted features with some remarks:

| feature               | remark                                                                                       |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| max z-axis Acc        | (see var of x-axis)                                                                          |

| max z freq energy     | (see max x freq energy)                                                                      |
| max total freq energy | (see max x freq energy)                                                                      |

##### 5. Operation classification

*Weka* was used for classifications.

I figured out that the mean of the z-axis and the mean of the total acceleration had a negative impact on the result (in
contradiction to my initial assumption stated in section 4). Therefore, I removed them.

**a) J48**

|               | TP Rate | FP Rate | Precision | Recall | F-Measure | MCC   | ROC Area | PRC Area | Class   |
|---------------|---------|---------|-----------|--------|-----------|-------|----------|----------|---------|
|               | 0,830   | 0,073   | 0,917     | 0,830  | 0,871     | 0,762 | 0,866    | 0,823    | screw   |
|               | 0,927   | 0,170   | 0,850     | 0,927  | 0,887     | 0,762 | 0,866    | 0,852    | unscrew |
| Weighted Avg. | 0,880   | 0,122   | 0,883     | 0,880  | 0,879     | 0,762 | 0,866    | 0,838    |         |

Parameter tuning:

* C (confidenceFactor): Changing the parameter _C_ has hardly any effect on the result. I increased it up to 0.8 and
  lowered it to 0.01 to see at least some effects but accuracy only gets worse.
* M (minNumObj): Changing the parameter _M_ only worsens the result. Similar to parameter _C_, only a significant change
  led to a change at all.

**b) NaÃ¯ve Bayes**

|               | TP Rate | FP Rate | Precision | Recall | F-Measure | MCC   | ROC Area | PRC Area | Class   |
|---------------|---------|---------|-----------|--------|-----------|-------|----------|----------|---------|
|               | 0,849   | 0,327   | 0,714     | 0,849  | 0,776     | 0,529 | 0,854    | 0,872    | screw   |
|               | 0,673   | 0,151   | 0,822     | 0,673  | 0,740     | 0,529 | 0,854    | 0,850    | unscrew |
| Weighted Avg. | 0,759   | 0,237   | 0,769     | 0,759  | 0,758     | 0,529 | 0,854    | 0,861    |         |

Naive bayes has no parameters in *Weka*.

**c) kNN **

|               | TP Rate | FP Rate | Precision | Recall | F-Measure | MCC   | ROC Area | PRC Area | Class   |
|---------------|---------|---------|-----------|--------|-----------|-------|----------|----------|---------|
|               | 0,962   | 0,036   | 0,962     | 0,962  | 0,962     | 0,926 | 0,983    | 0,971    | screw   |
|               | 0,964   | 0,038   | 0,964     | 0,964  | 0,964     | 0,926 | 0,983    | 0,981    | unscrew |
| Weighted Avg. | 0,963   | 0,037   | 0,963     | 0,963  | 0,963     | 0,926 | 0,983    | 0,976    |         |

Parameter tuning:

* k: I increased the parameter _k_ (number of nearest neighbors) until the accuracy declined, which was at 3. This
  allowed me to increase accuracy from 93.52% to 96.3%.
* W: Increasing _W_ was not effective. A lower number decreased accuracy drastically, whereas choosing a large number (>
  =100) led to the initial result.

**d) Multilayer perceptron**

|               | TP Rate | FP Rate | Precision | Recall | F-Measure | MCC   | ROC Area | PRC Area | Class   |
|---------------|---------|---------|-----------|--------|-----------|-------|----------|----------|---------|
|               | 0,943   | 0,036   | 0,962     | 0,943  | 0,952     | 0,907 | 0,996    | 0,996    | screw   |
|               | 0,964   | 0,057   | 0,946     | 0,964  | 0,955     | 0,907 | 0,996    | 0,996    | unscrew |
| Weighted Avg. | 0,954   | 0,047   | 0,954     | 0,954  | 0,954     | 0,907 | 0,996    | 0,996    |         |

Parameter tuning:

- L (learningRate): A decrease to 0.1 results in an accuracy increase by 0.93%. If I would decrease the parameter even
  more or increase it the outcome would be negative.
- M (momentum): Setting the parameter to 0.25 improves the ROC- and PRC area slightly by 0.1%.
- N (trainingTime): Changing the parameter _N_ has no effect on the result.
- V (validationSetSize): Accuracy falls with larger parameter _V_.
- S (seed): Changing the parameter _S_ has no effect on the result.
- E (validationThreshold): Changing the parameter _E_ has no effect on the result.

**Summary**

In summary, the kNN algorithm performed best with an accuracy of 96.3%. It also achieved the lowest FP rate at
3.7%. Nonetheless, the multilayer perceptron has the best ROC- and PRC area. Overall I regard the kNN as the best
solution for this particular classification problem.

##### 6. Grip classification

*Weka* was used for classifications.

I used the Weka visualization to filter out less significant features by hand, which in this classification task is the
mean of the y-axis.

**a) J48**

|               | TP Rate | FP Rate | Precision | Recall | F-Measure | MCC   | ROC Area | PRC Area | Class |
|---------------|---------|---------|-----------|--------|-----------|-------|----------|----------|-------|
|               | 0,982   | 0,058   | 0,948     | 0,982  | 0,965     | 0,926 | 0,939    | 0,907    | grip1 |
|               | 0,942   | 0,018   | 0,980     | 0,942  | 0,961     | 0,926 | 0,939    | 0,928    | grip2 |
| Weighted Avg. | 0,963   | 0,039   | 0,964     | 0,963  | 0,963     | 0,926 | 0,939    | 0,917    |       |

Parameter tuning:

* C (confidenceFactor): Changing the parameter _C_ only worsens the result.
* M (minNumObj): Decreasing the parameter _M_ has no impact on classifier performance. However, increasing it to a value
  of 5 improved accuracy by 1.85%.

**b) NaÃ¯ve Bayes**

|               | TP Rate | FP Rate | Precision | Recall | F-Measure | MCC   | ROC Area | PRC Area | Class |
|---------------|---------|---------|-----------|--------|-----------|-------|----------|----------|-------|
|               | 0,982   | 0,058   | 0,948     | 0,982  | 0,965     | 0,926 | 0,992    | 0,994    | grip1 |
|               | 0,942   | 0,018   | 0,980     | 0,942  | 0,961     | 0,926 | 0,992    | 0,992    | grip2 |
| Weighted Avg. | 0,963   | 0,039   | 0,964     | 0,963  | 0,963     | 0,926 | 0,992    | 0,993    |       |

Naive bayes has no parameters in *Weka*.

**c) kNN **

|               | TP Rate | FP Rate | Precision | Recall | F-Measure | MCC   | ROC Area | PRC Area | Class |
|---------------|---------|---------|-----------|--------|-----------|-------|----------|----------|-------|
|               | 1,000   | 0,019   | 0,982     | 1,000  | 0,991     | 0,982 | 0,999    | 0,998    | grip1 |
|               | 0,981   | 0,000   | 1,000     | 0,981  | 0,990     | 0,982 | 0,999    | 0,998    | grip2 |
| Weighted Avg. | 0,991   | 0,010   | 0,991     | 0,991  | 0,991     | 0,982 | 0,999    | 0,998    |       |

Parameter tuning:

* k: I increased the parameter _k_ until I reached an accuracy of 99.1%, which was at 2. I could not extract a better
  result with larger _k_.
* W: Changing _W_ only deteriorated the performance.

**d) Multilayer perceptron**

|               | TP Rate | FP Rate | Precision | Recall | F-Measure | MCC   | ROC Area | PRC Area | Class |
|---------------|---------|---------|-----------|--------|-----------|-------|----------|----------|-------|
|               | 0,964   | 0,019   | 0,982     | 0,964  | 0,973     | 0,945 | 0,993    | 0,994    | grip1 |
|               | 0,981   | 0,036   | 0,962     | 0,981  | 0,971     | 0,945 | 0,993    | 0,993    | grip2 |
| Weighted Avg. | 0,972   | 0,027   | 0,972     | 0,972  | 0,972     | 0,945 | 0,993    | 0,993    |       |

Parameter tuning:

- L (learningRate): A decrease to 0.1 leads to an accuracy increase by 1%. Any increase or further decrease of parameter
  _L_ has an unfavourable effect on the classifier performance.
- M (momentum): Changing the parameter _M_ worsens the accuracy.
- N (trainingTime): Increasing the training time worsens the accuracy, decreasing it slightly has no effect.
- V (validationSetSize): Accuracy falls with larger parameter _V_.
- S (seed): After trying various seeds I only achieved to decrease accuracy.
- E (validationThreshold): Changing the parameter _E_ has no effect on the result.

**Summary**

All classifiers perform very well guessing the used grip. However, kNN produces the best outcome with an accuracy of
99.1%. Furthermore, kNN also has the lowest false positive rate at 1% and the largest ROC- and PRC area (99.9% and
99.8%). The multilayer perceptron comes second with an accuracy of 97.2%. Note that j48 and naive bayes have identical
accuracies (96.3%) and false positive rates (3.9%).
